📜 Infrastructure Design
Here’s the setup:

Components:

1 server → physical or virtual machine with IP 8.8.8.8

1 web server → Nginx (handles HTTP requests)

1 application server → e.g., Gunicorn (for Python) or PHP-FPM (for PHP)

Application files → the codebase for the site (HTML, CSS, JS, backend code)

1 database → MySQL for persistent storage

Domain name → foobar.com with a www record pointing to 8.8.8.8

Flow of a request:

User types www.foobar.com into their browser.

DNS translates www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8 (server IP).

Browser sends an HTTP request to 8.8.8.8.

Nginx (web server) receives the request.

Nginx forwards it to the application server.

Application server executes code from the application files, possibly querying the MySQL database.

Application server returns the response to Nginx.

Nginx sends the final HTML back to the user’s browser.

🔍 Role of Each Component
Server → The physical/virtual machine hosting all components.

Domain name → Human-friendly address (foobar.com) that maps to the server’s IP.

DNS record → The www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME or A record (A record maps directly to IP, CNAME maps to another name).

Web server (Nginx) → Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

Application server → Runs backend code, processes business logic, interacts with the database.

Database (MySQL) → Stores persistent application data.

Communication protocol → HTTP or HTTPS over TCP/IP.

⚠ Issues with This Setup
SPOF (Single Point of Failure)

If the one server goes down, the website becomes unreachable.

Downtime during maintenance

Deploying new code or restarting Nginx will cause temporary service interruption.

Scaling limitations

One server can only handle limited traffic before slowing down or crashing.
